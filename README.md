# bypass
This is trivial middleware for Go in which it allows you omit middleware chains for
certain routes that don't require all of the handlers you are using.

### Install
You can always run `go get` or use some package manager for Go like `gb` or `glide` to use it.
Bypass plays nicely with [Alice](https://github.com/justinas/alice) as well.
